Semester 1 project

## Description
### 1. Project background
Student Housing BV offers accommodation to students in the Netherlands. They have different buildings with private rooms and shared facilities like kitchen, bathroom, hallway, etc.
### 2. Problem definition
Student Housing BV has been facing some issues with students that do not do their duties. Some students report others for not cleaning the bathrooms/toilets..., not paying the shared items (toilet paper, dish soap..), organizing parties without announcing, and many others. 
### 3. Project goal
The project goal is to help Student Housing BV to create an efficient way for students to plan their day-to-day activities, using IT solutions! In the planning you can find all the deliverables required for the successful software solution.
### 4. Result
Application for the Student Housing BV clients in which students are able to see the house rules and employees are able to add and update them. Every student has a personal wallet, in which they are able to deposit money, which they can use for paying for supplies and fines. Students can add complaints with options to stay anonymous and announcements for specific events with a date, time and place. Students can see tasks that they have to do and info for every task (how much time they have until they receive a penalty, how much they have to pay, etc.) Moreover, there is a COVID-19 page where students can request a test and be quarantined depending on the result of the test. In the contact page, students can see common questions and get an answer to their problems.
